## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- Homebrew must be installed
- Node.js and pnpm (for development)

### Development Setup
``` bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wickenico/WailBrew.git
cd WailBrew

# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && pnpm install

# Start the app in development mode
cd .. && make dev
# or alternatively: wails dev
```
### Production Build
``` bash
# Recommended: Build with automatic version from package.json
make

# Alternative: Standard build (uses hardcoded default version)
wails build

# The built app will be in the build/bin/ directory
```

**Note**: Use `make` for production builds as it automatically reads the version from `frontend/package.json` and embeds it in the binary. This ensures the About dialog displays the correct version in production.

### Additional Make Commands
``` bash
make dev     # Start development server
make clean   # Clean build directory
make install # Build and install to /Applications
```

### Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.
